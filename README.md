This is a simple client-side mod that gives you the ability to avoid mining certain blocks. 

For example, block all ores while you're mining without Silktouch or Fortune so you can save them for later! Or perhaps only allow yourself to mine large amethyst buds so that you don't accidentally break the budding block!

## Usage
Simply press 'M' to open the GUI and select the blocks you want to block or allow. The keybind can be changed in the controls menu, and you can also choose to remove it in favour of ModMenu.

The config file for this mod is located in the `config` folder of your Minecraft directory, and is called `mineprevention.json`. It only contains a deny list, to minimise the amount of data stored.
